				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>During the summer and fall of 2020, I had the opportunity to join Sovos as an UX Design Intern. Over the past months, I worked with a team of 7 UX designers. I collaborated with cross-functional teams to ideate and brainstorm, to conduct usability testing, and to develop prototypes to hand off to development.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="introduction" class="project-section">
				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>Sovos is on a mission to ‚ÄúSolve Tax for Good‚Äù by eliminating businesses from risk of modern tax compliance. It delivers technology solutions for tax determination, e-invoicing and tax reporting. The Sovos Intelligent Compliance Cloud supports over 7,000 customers, including half of the Fortune 500. </p>

				<h2>What I Worked On</h2>
				<p>I will be describing some of the work I got to do at Sovos! For confidentiality reasons, I will be describing my projects at a high-level.</p>


				<h3>Project 1 - Sovos Designer‚Äôs Toolkit</h3>
				<p>This is a design ops project. The goal is to help designers on the team with new projects in terms of process. There are a lot of resources and processes defined, and I created a central location that would help make new designer onboarding easier in the future.</p>
				<img class="image-card" src="img/sovos/toolkit1.png" alt="Sovos' Designer's Toolkit" onContextMenu="return false;" width="350">
				<img class="image-card" src="img/sovos/toolkit2.jpg" alt="Sovos' Designer's Toolkit" onContextMenu="return false;" width="350">
				<p class="caption">Images are blurred for confidentiality.</p>
				<p>I facilitated interviews with lead designers and learned about collaboration between cross-functional teams to understand the Sovos‚Äô design process. I gathered the results and created a design toolkit that is now published for the UX team to reference.</p>
				<!-- <br>
				<br>
				I am currently working on a Research Toolkit that will be implemented by the end of the year! -->
				<div class="purple-section">
					<p class="purple bold">TAKEAWAYS</p>
					<p>Creating this toolkit pushed me to research and learn more about different design frameworks. Through creating this toolkit for the team, I was able to refine my design process at the same time. </p>
				</div>


				<h3 class="space-above-large">Project 2 - TIR Enterprise</h3>
				<p>The purpose of the TIR Enterprise software is to help ensure clients are compliant with 1099 reporting. It automates error-prone manual processes, and alerts clients of regulatory changes. Sovos is the largest filer of 1099 forms in the world!
				<br>
				<br>
				The product that I worked on is meant to support clients in verifying TIN records against the IRS database, and soliciting missing TIN information. I participated in stakeholder meetings, and collaborated with lead designers to develop the final interface.</p>
				<img class="image-card" src="img/sovos/tirenterprise.jpg" alt="TIR Enterprise Workflow" onContextMenu="return false;">
				<p class="caption">Project workflow. Images are blurred for confidentiality.</p>
				<p>I facilitated usability testing sessions, and was able to learn a lot by speaking with users with expertise in the compliance process. I was able to diagnose issues in the prototype, which I recorded in an excel sheet.</p>
				<img class="image-card" src="img/sovos/usabilitytesting.jpg" alt="Usability Testing" onContextMenu="return false;">
				<p class="caption">Images are blurred for confidentiality.</p>
				<div class="purple-section">
					<p class="purple bold">TAKEAWAYS</p>
					<p>Because I onboarded this project after much of the initial research and brainstorming was done, the learning curve here was huge for me. Through this experience, I recognized the importance of proactively reaching out to cross-functional leadership regularly, and consistently facilitating collaboration between everyone.</p>
				</div>


				<h3 class="space-above-large">Project 3 - Ship Compliant‚Äôs New Dashboard</h3>
				<p>The Ship Compliant line of business helps distributors be compliant of taxes during the shipment of alcohol and beverages, as well as a variety of other goods. It automates sales tax against regulations to make sure that all shipments are legal. One of Sovos‚Äô biggest clients in this space is FedEx!
				<br>
				<br>
				Ship Compliant has an old dashboard (over 9 years old!). I was responsible for the design of the new dash. I collaborated with lead designers, product managers, and development to create the final interface.</p>

				<p class="caption">Receiving feedback on my work through Miro. Images are blurred for confidentiality.</p>
				<div class="purple-section">
					<p class="purple bold">TAKEAWAYS</p>
					<p>Ship Compliant is a legacy product with no design system, and I was allowed the freedom to design all components and interactions on the page. It was super exciting to design with little constraints!</p>
				</div>

				<h3 class="space-above-large">Project 4 - UX Team Logo</h3>
				<p>One of the first projects I did over the summer was create a logo for the UX team! I created a UX specific logo that adheres to the Sovos brand. I checked in with the design team frequently for feedback to finalize the design.</p>

				<h3>Frideation</h3>
				<p>Every Friday, the design team held ‚ÄúFrideation‚Äù, where we got to spend relaxing time with each other at the end of the week and share fun and inspirational content.</p>
				<img class="image-card" src="img/sovos/frideation.jpg" alt="UX Team Frideation" onContextMenu="return false;">
				<p class="caption">The team looks through ‚ÄúGoat User Stories‚Äù on Twitter.</p>

				<h3>UX Team Retreat</h3>
				<p>I got the chance to join the annual UX Team Rally, where we went through a hefty schedule of creative activities and games. This was definitely one of the highlights of my internship!</p>
